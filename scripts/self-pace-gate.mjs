// PreToolUse hard-gate: blocks SELF-PACE for sub-agents.
//
// Governance control (2026-06-26, after the autonom-kor incident: a sub-agent
// scheduled its own wakeups via ScheduleWakeup, fed itself prompts, and acted
// on a SELF-GENERATED "A) zárjuk le" decision -- dispatching real development
// -- while the operator slept. Two independent adversarial audits confirmed the
// root cause is the agent's own self-pace loop, not an external vector).
//
// A sub-agent must be INPUT-DRIVEN: it acts on operator / peer messages, never
// on prompts it scheduled for itself. This gate blocks every self-pace path:
//   - the Claude Code runtime tools ScheduleWakeup / CronCreate / CronList /
//     CronDelete / RemoteTrigger (the autonomous-loop machinery), AND
//   - the Bash escape routes that achieve the same self-injection: writing the
//     Claude scheduled_tasks.json directly, tmux send-keys into a session,
//     POSTing a new schedule to the dashboard, or an OS scheduler (crontab / at /
//     launchctl / systemd-run, and a systemd timer armed with systemctl or
//     written into a unit directory). One exact systemd-run form, the memory
//     guard's foreground scope, is allowed: see SF_HEAVY_SCOPE_RX.
//
// Why a hook and not only a permissions deny-list: permissive profiles launch
// with --dangerously-skip-permissions. A whole-tool-name deny DOES survive that
// (deny is checked before the bypass allow), so the scaffold also adds these
// names to permissions.deny -- but the Bash-command routes can ONLY be caught
// by a PreToolUse hook, which runs regardless of permission mode. Defense in
// depth: deny-list for the tool names, this hook for the Bash routes (+ the
// names again, redundantly fail-closed).
//
// Wired into every sub-agent's .claude/settings.json by
// writeAgentSettingsFromProfile() (agent-scaffold.ts), guarded by
// name !== MAIN_AGENT_ID, re-applied on every spawn (respawn-safe).

// `at` and `batch` are also ordinary English words, and splitSegments splits on

// a flag, an input redirect, or an at(1) TIMESPEC (which at(1) requires anyway,

// -v and -V look it up), exec -a, stdbuf, setsid, flock <file>, doas, runuser, xargs as

// -o f -f %M crontab -r` and `time -p crontab -r` passed).
//
// valued: option letters that take a value, attached (`-uroot`) or as the next word;
// separate: letters whose value is always the next word; long: long options with a
// value (`--user=x` or `--user x`); bare: an option word without a value; needs: a word
// the wrapper takes after its options (timeout's duration, flock's lock file). Letters
// and names in any case, as the regexes read them with the i flag. The reader follows
// every reading of an option word at once (valued, bare, and the end of the options),
// so reading one wrong costs nothing: the masked view blanks a quoted value (`-f "%e
// %M"`), and there the bare reading keeps the command word after it. A wrapper is known
// by its last path component, and `--` ends its options: both are new for all but time
// (`/usr/bin/env crontab -r` and `nice -- crontab -r` passed).
// sf-heavy (fejlesztes-vezeto 54258) runs its command in the memory guard's scope:

// `sf-heavy -- crontab -r` passed: the gate saw sf-heavy as the command. sf-heavy-ctl is no

// --- where a command word starts: read by a loop -----------------------------------
//
// ffc45c28 (teszter 39223/39224, fejlesztes-vezeto 54307): the words in front of a
// command word were read by regexes, and their alternatives overlapped: an option that
// takes a value or none (`sudo -u`), a wrapper word two parts both read (`sudo`,
// `time`), `\s` over the newlines that also start a command, `(?:\S*/)?` from every
// `(`. Where no command word followed, the backtracking grew with the input: `time `
// x30000 + `true; crontab -r` (150 KB) took 10.05 s, and the hook FAILS OPEN after
// 10 s, so a slow gate is a bypass. Measured before this change (kimenet/ffc45c28
// redos-meres-3/4): 40 option words of `sudo -u`, `time -o` or `timeout -s` over 20 s;
// 150 000 newlines over 20 s; on develop 6158290b too, 30000 `sudo(` 2.3 s.
//
// So a loop walks the words. From each start it follows every way to read them --
// keyword, assignment, wrapper, each reading of an option word -- and reports each
// place where a command word can start. A (word, state) pair is taken once, however
// many readings lead to it, so the time is linear in the command. It reads every
// prefix the regexes read, and the few more named at WRAPPERS.

// --- the one systemd-run form this gate allows ----------------------------------
//
// Card 90a2257b (074645b4, ügyvezető 52651 K2). The memory guard on the fleet host
// runs every heavy compile (tsc, next build) through scripts/infra-ops/sf-heavy,
// which starts it in a FOREGROUND transient scope with a memory cap:
//   systemd-run --user --scope --quiet --collect --slice=sf-heavy.slice
//     --unit=sf-heavy-<label> -p MemoryMax=<size> -- /usr/bin/time -o <file> -f %M <command>
// A scope runs its command now and ends with it: no timer, no --on-*, no service
// that outlives the call, so it schedules nothing. The operator accepted exactly
// this form and asked for a documented exception here instead of a blind spot.
// So this ONE form -- these options in this order, unquoted, at a command
// position (also after a shell keyword, as the scheduler check reads one), nothing (no
// sudo, env, path) in front of the binary -- is transparent
// to the gate: the prefix and the time tail are replaced by a command separator,
// and the command after them is judged as if it were run directly, so a scheduler,
// a timer or a pane injection behind the prefix is still denied. Every other systemd-run (an
// --on-* or timer option, no --scope, another slice or unit name, another
// property, another order) is not this form and stays denied by the scheduler check.
// The label charset is the one sf-heavy writes (tr -c 'A-Za-z0-9_.-' '-').
// The GNU time tail is part of the form (teszter 38794): it goes with the prefix,
// so the gate judges the command behind it exactly as if it ran on its own.
// Before, /usr/bin/time was the command the gate saw, and a scheduler behind it
// went through. The tail is exactly `/usr/bin/time -o <file> -f %M`, the file a
// plain word, a plain $NAME or ${NAME}, or a quoted string of those: never a
// command substitution or a backquote, because whatever sits in the removed tail
// is never judged. Any other tail (none, no -o, another format, an expansion in
// the file name) is not the form, and the whole systemd-run stays denied.
// A variable in the file name is read whole: `$AB` is the variable AB, never the
// variable A and a letter B. Measured 2026-09-30 (fejleszto, after teszter 39223):
// with both readings open, a tail that is not the form (`-f %N`) was retried over
// every way to split the names, exponentially: 26 variables of two letters took 1 s
// in a 214-byte command, 32 of them would pass the hook's 10 s limit, and the hook
// fails open. One reading per character keeps the match linear.

// --- systemd timers -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Measured 2026-09-27: an agent installed a systemd USER timer in two steps --
// wrote the unit files into ~/.config/systemd/user, then ran `systemctl --user
// enable --now <name>.timer` -- and the timer's job messaged the agent's own
// queue on a finding, so the agent woke up on turns it had scheduled for itself,
// twice in an hour. The scheduler check catches `systemd-run` (a transient timer in one
// call), but neither of these steps: `systemctl` is not a scheduler binary, and
// writing a file is not an invocation.
//
// An inventory of one install two days later (43 timer units) showed how agents
// actually create them: 36 through Bash (among them 23 a heredoc redirect into
// the unit file and 9 a cp/install of prepared unit files, the unit directory
// often held in a variable), 1 with the Edit tool, and in 9 the write and the
// enable were separate tool calls. So each step is checked on its own, and
// either one alone is a deny:
//   (a) systemctl with a timer argument and a verb that is not a pure read or a
//       disarm. An ALLOWLIST on purpose: enable, start, restart, reenable, link,
//       edit, add-wants, unmask, and any verb systemd adds later arm a timer;
//   (b) a write whose target is a timer unit in a systemd unit directory: a
//       redirect, tee, cp/mv/install/ln/rsync, dd of=, sed -i, a script's write
//       call (open(..., 'w'), write_text, writeFileSync, shutil.copy, ...), and
//       the native Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tools.
// Reading stays allowed: status, show, cat, list-timers, is-active, is-enabled,
// journalctl, cat/ls/grep/diff on a unit file, copying a unit file OUT of the
// directory. So do stopping and disabling a timer, and running a .service once.
//
// Like the scheduler check, both shell checks read what the SHELL would run: quoted text
// and heredoc bodies are inert (maskInertLiterals), so a message or a card
// comment that quotes the very command is not a deny. A unit name or a path in
// quotes is still an argument, so those are read from the command with only the
// heredoc bodies blanked. Unlike the scheduler check, one `"...$(...)..."` does not
// send the WHOLE command to the naive split: measured on 3250 real commands that
// mention systemctl, a unit directory or a timer, that fallback let the prose of
// quoted heredoc bodies (messages, card comments) read as commands, and most of
// those commands carry a `"$(date ...)"` somewhere. Here only that one region
// stays visible (maskInertLiterals `strict: false`).
//
// KNOWN LIMITATIONS, the same class as the other anchored checks: a wrapper that
// WRAPPERS does not know, a command fed to an interpreter as a quoted heredoc (`bash
// <<'EOF'`, `ssh host bash -s <<'EOF'`), a unit name that only a runtime
// expansion yields, an existing timer edited through a script's argv, and a
// script file that does it all (the gate sees `bash install.sh`, not what it runs).
//
// A systemd unit directory: the directory systemd loads unit files from, or one
// of its .wants/.requires/.upholds/.d subdirectories (an enable symlink, a
// drop-in). A file elsewhere under it (a `retired/` folder) is never loaded.

//   - A $(...) or backtick substitution that assigns a scheduler result

//     reads a command position after both `(` and the backtick.

//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-05, five denials in one morning -- three
// mine, two taric's): splitSegments is not quote-aware, so PROSE can manufacture
// a command position that never existed. All five denials had the same cause: a
// grep pattern quoted inside an inter-agent message,
//   Minta: stop.sh <bar> launchctl <bar> com.janna.dashboard
// The `<bar>` split it, the middle piece trimmed down to the bare word
// `launchctl`, and the scheduler check's end-of-segment branch reads a bare `launchctl`
// as a real (interactive) invocation -- correctly, for a real command line.
// Nothing was scheduled; five messages simply never went out. From outside, a
// hard-gate denial is indistinguishable from an agent that stayed silent.
//
// The route decided it: the SAME text passes as `curl -d '<json>'` (the payload
// is blanked by stripDataPayloads) and is denied when sent from a python
// heredoc, which has no -d argument to blank. Choosing how to send a message
// had quietly become a security decision. stripDataPayloads' own comment names
// this false-positive class as its target -- it is implemented for exactly one
// route, so the gap is unfinished work, not an oversight.
//
// SCOPE, and this is the part that matters: the result feeds ONLY the anchored
// scheduler check. The unanchored patterns (tmux+send-keys, nohup+claude,
// claude+/loop) keep scanning naive segments, quoted regions included, because
// they do NOT depend on a command position that prose can fake -- and because
// measurement showed the naive scan is what catches a real
// `subprocess.run(['tmux','send-keys',...])` hidden in a heredoc body. Handing
// them quote-aware segments would have removed the detection of the very
// incident vector this gate was built for, under the banner of a structural fix.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED in three places, because "could not parse" must mean "scan more",
// never "scan less":
//   - unterminated quote or heredoc -> null (caller uses the naive split)
//   - a double-quoted region containing $(...) or a backtick -> null; the shell
//     runs what is inside, so a `;` in there IS a real separator
//   - a heredoc with an UNQUOTED tag whose body contains $(...) or a backtick
//     -> null, same reason (an unquoted tag expands the body)
// NOTE ON THE SHAPE OF THIS FIX. The first attempt made the SEGMENTER
// quote-aware and left the regexes alone. It failed one corpus case:
//   echo 'grep: foo <bar> crontab <bar> bar'
// stayed denied, because the scheduler regex carried its OWN boundary anchor
// (the bar among them), so it re-found a command position INSIDE a
// segment. Keeping the quoted text in the segment at all was the mistake. The
// `launchctl` cases passed only by luck -- LAUNCHCTL_SUBCOMMAND's lookahead
// happened to reject the following bar. So the primitive is not "split more
// carefully", it is "the inert text must not be there": mask it out, then let
// the existing splitter and regexes run unchanged on what remains.
//
// `{ quotes: false }` blanks the heredoc bodies only and keeps the quoted text as
// it is (same length): a quoted word can be an ARGUMENT -- a unit name, a path --
// and the systemd-timer check reads its arguments from that.
// `{ strict: false }` does not give up on a region that can command-substitute
// (a double-quoted string or an unquoted-tag heredoc body with $(...) or a
// backtick): it keeps THAT region as it is, visible, and masks the rest. Only an
// unterminated quote or heredoc is still null. The scheduler check keeps the
// strict default; the systemd-timer check uses this.

// `<<<` is read from its second `<`, the closing match starts at the first line start

// and this PR is scoped to these two loop regressions). This cannot introduce a
