"""PreToolUse hook (matcher: the Telegram reply tool): before a QUESTION goes to an
OWNER, look it up in that owner's own earlier inbound messages and put the best
matches in front of the model. Card fc282e39. Before a NEGATIVE CLAIM goes to an
owner, ask for a lookup in the same round. Card b2a292b2.

Why: a question to an owner costs the owner's time, and the measured failure was
a question whose answer the owner had already written in an earlier message. A
written rule ("look before you ask") did not stop it; this hook makes the lookup
mechanical. The first version only reported; the second step (card fc282e39,
brief 43694, cap decision 43824) holds such a question back ONCE, see WHEN IT
HOLDS A QUESTION BACK. The same failure on the other side of a reply -- "nincs",
"nem volt", "senki nem" said without looking back -- is NEGATIVE CLAIMS.

WHEN IT SPEAKS
  - the tool is the Telegram reply tool, and
  - the outgoing text asks something: a sentence that carries "?" once code
    blocks, inline code and links are removed (a "?" in a URL query string is
    not a question), or it makes a negative claim (NEGATIVE CLAIMS), and
  - chat_id belongs to a principal whose role is owner or sysadmin_owner in
    store/principals.json, read at run time: no chat id lives in this file.
    An install WITHOUT that file is a single-owner install: there the owner is
    the install's owner chat (LEDGER_OWNER_CHAT, else scripts/lib/owner_chat,
    the resolution the ledger uses), and with no resolvable owner the hook is
    silent. A file that exists but cannot be read is said out loud.
  Everything else is silence, so silence always means "not applicable". Once it
  applies it always says something, a zero result included ("korábbi üzenet nem
  található"), so a missing hint is never ambiguous.

HOW IT SEARCHES (card fc282e39)
  Keywords come from the QUESTION SENTENCES, not the whole reply: a whole reply
  shares some word with too many earlier messages to filter anything, while a
  question sentence alone carries just a few keywords.
  A keyword is a token of 4+ characters after accent folding (NFD, combining
  marks dropped) that is not on the filler list; it is cut to a 6-character stem
  so that Hungarian suffixes meet (asztal / asztalt / asztalok). Candidates are
  the conversation_log inbound rows (direction 'in') of the same chat_id from the
  last 30 days, over a read-only connection. A stem is RARE when at most RARE_DF
  candidate rows carry it. A row is a HIT when it shares
    - 2+ distinct stems with the question, at least one of them rare, or
    - 1 stem that only this row carries, from a question word of UNIQUE_MIN_LEN+
      characters (one long, specific word -- a name, a term -- is enough alone).
  The rule is deliberately stricter than "2 stems, or 1 rare stem": a hint that
  comes with nearly every question stops being read.
  Hits are ranked by the summed inverse document frequency of the shared stems,
  then by recency; the best MAX_HITS are shown with time, age, message id and
  the first EXCERPT characters. Whether a hit really holds the ANSWER is not
  measured here (that needs a human reading the messages).

WHEN IT HOLDS A QUESTION BACK (the second step)
  An owner question WITH hits is denied once: permissionDecision "deny", and the
  reason carries the hits (time, age, message id, the first EXCERPT characters),
  so the model reads them BEFORE the question goes out and decides whether to
  send it at all. The deny is remembered per chat as the sha256 of the text with
  its whitespace collapsed (NFC): sending the SAME text to the same chat again
  passes, so the hook holds a question back once and never loops on it. An
  edited text is a new question, so a CAP bounds the rest: once a chat has had
  CAP_MAX_DENIES denies within CAP_WINDOW_S, the next question with hits passes,
  saying so ("a kapu a korlát miatt átengedte"), with the hits as context. A
  remembered text expires after DENY_MEMORY_S. A question with no hits, with no
  keyword, or whose lookup could not run is never held back.
  The memory is a JSON file (store/owner-question-denies.json: chat id -> text
  hashes and deny times, never the text itself), read and written under an
  exclusive lock with an atomic replace.

NEGATIVE CLAIMS (card b2a292b2)
  A clause -- a sentence cut at ";", at a ":" that ends a phrase and at a
  spaced " - " -- without "?" is a negative claim when it carries
  "nincs"/"sincs", "nem volt", "senki / semmi / sehol / soha nem", "nem
  létezik", "nem elérhető" / "nem érhető el", or a predicative "lejárt"
  ("lejártak", "lejárt a ...", clause-final, "a bérlet lejárt, ...", "már
  lejárt, ..."). Not a claim (the false positives the detector must avoid): a
  marker after "ha", "hogyha", "amennyiben", "amíg", "szerinte" or "szerintük"
  in the same or the previous comma segment (a condition, someone else's
  claim); a no-action idiom ("nincs teendőd", "nincs mit", "nincs szükség",
  "nincs köze"); a capitalised marker inside a clause (a UI label or list
  item: "..., Nincs előnézet, ..."); anything in quotes; an attributive
  "lejárt" ("lejárt bérlet", "lejárt, elveszett", "a már lejárt bérlet"). The
  price of that last rule: a predicative "lejárt" before a content word ("a
  bérlet délben lejárt jelzés nélkül") is missed.
  A claim needs a LOOKUP in the same round: a tool call whose result the model
  has already seen, made after the owner's latest message (the ledger's ts)
  and within LOOKUP_WINDOW_S, that read the conversation log
  (conversation_log), the memory (/api/memories, /api/daily-log, a memory/
  file) or the kanban (/api/kanban, the kanban tables). A write -- a
  POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, a data flag without -G, a redirect into memory/ -- is
  not a lookup. The round comes from the session transcript (the payload's
  transcript_path), read from its end: the main agent's turns run for hours
  and take new messages in mid-turn, so a turn is no measure of a round.
  With a lookup the reply passes, the note naming the sources. Without one it
  is held back ONCE, through the question path's memory and cap (one text, one
  deny: a resend of the same text passes, a lookup lets an edited text pass),
  and the reason carries the claims, the hook's own conversation_log hits for
  their keywords, and the instruction to look and to name the source. A reply
  that both asks and claims is held back once, both in the one reason. No
  transcript, or one that cannot be read: the reply passes, said out loud, and
  hook-errors.log gets a line.

WHERE THE HINT GOES (measured in the installed Claude Code 2.1.283 binary)
  The hook JSON's `systemMessage` becomes a hook_system_message attachment whose
  model-side rendering is empty: the pane shows "<hook> says: ...", the model
  gets nothing. `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` becomes a
  hook_additional_context attachment that reaches the model as a meta message,
  but with the tool call, i.e. only AFTER the question went out; so every
  passing outcome carries its note there. A "deny" becomes the tool call's
  blocking error: the call does not run and the reason is what the model reads
  instead of the tool result (card comment 30334). Several PreToolUse hooks on
  the same tool combine by rank (deny > ask > allow), so another gate's allow
  cannot swallow this deny, and this hook never returns allow or ask: apart from
  the one deny it takes no part in the other gates' outcome. The binary also
  caps a deny reason at 20 lines and 2000 characters on the hook paths it
  sanitises (hooks served to an attached machine or a cloud session); the
  reason is kept inside both limits (REASON_MAX_*), shedding hits if it must.

THE QUOTES ARE DATA
  The excerpts are the owner's own earlier messages, and some of them are
  instructions ("send it to X"). Replayed as context they could read as a new
  order, so the hint frames them as quotes and says not to act on them.

FAIL DIRECTION
  exit 0 on every path, and a deny only when the deny is REMEMBERED: if the
  memory cannot be read, parsed, locked or written, the question passes with
  the hits and a note that it was not held back (a deny that is not remembered
  would repeat on every resend, and an owner reply must never hang on this
  gate). When the text asks something but the principals file or the ledger
  cannot be read, the hint says the lookup did NOT run (a silent failure would
  read as "not an owner question"). Each such failure also writes one line to
  store/hook-errors.log (hook_errlog).

Test overrides: LEDGER_DB_PATH (through ledger_lib), LEDGER_PRINCIPALS_PATH,
LEDGER_OWNER_CHAT, OWNER_QUESTION_NOW (epoch seconds: fixes the clock of the
30-day window and of the deny memory), OWNER_QUESTION_STATE_PATH (the memory file).
