"""
Take /status and /help away from the Telegram channel plugin (ELSOKOR922 D-4),
mark forwarded messages in the inbound meta (forwarded="1"), and record every
inbound message the bot receives (the evidence owner WRITE commands need).

The official plugin (claude-plugins-official/telegram/<ver>/server.ts) answers
/status ("Paired as ...") and /help itself, inside its bot poller -- those
messages never reach the session, so Marveen's command hook
(scripts/hooks/marveen-commands.py) cannot answer them. This script removes
the two handlers (and the plugin's own command menu, which would advertise
them with the plugin's meaning), leaving /start and everything else intact.
Without the handlers the two words arrive as ordinary text messages, exactly
like /usage does today, and the hook takes them.

Runs at every channel start (scripts/channels.sh), before the plugin is
spawned, over every cached plugin version in ONE cache: the one this install
launches from ($CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/plugins/cache, or ~/.claude/plugins/cache
when the variable is unset). Never both: an install with its own config dir
must not rewrite the user-level cache other Claude Code sessions load
(maintainer review on #1529, 2026-09-25).

- idempotent: a file carrying the marker is left alone;
- all-or-nothing per patch: if ANY anchor of a patch is missing (a plugin
  update changed the code), that patch is left out and one loud line says so
  -- /status and /help then fall back to the plugin's own answers, or a
  forwarded command is not refused; the channel itself is not touched;
- always exits 0: a failed patch must never stop the channel from starting;
- the reply-keyboard patch (c67f5f34) inserts WHOLE LINES only, each carrying
  its marker, so taking it back is deleting the lines that carry
  "MARVEEN-PATCH(c67f5f34-kbd)" (the file is then byte-identical to the one
  patched without it; tested);
- the permission-approver patch (fc8629d7) works the same way, and it is the
  one patch that fails CLOSED: when its anchors are not all there, a one-line
  fallback (perm-off) takes the plugin's permission capability away, so a
  permission request reaches nobody's chat instead of every allowlisted one;
- with --state FILE, the outcome per file (and per patch) is written there as
  JSON, so /status can say in one line when a patch is missing
  (src/web/system-status.ts) instead of the command silently falling back.

Usage: patch-telegram-plugin.py [--state FILE] [<plugins cache root>]
(default root: $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/plugins/cache, else ~/.claude/plugins/cache)
