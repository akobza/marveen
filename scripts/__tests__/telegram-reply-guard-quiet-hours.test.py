"""Quiet-hours contract for scripts/hooks/telegram-reply-guard.py (cards 30d968cd / 352c3b42).

Run: python3 scripts/__tests__/telegram-reply-guard-quiet-hours.test.py
Exit 0 = pass. Discovered and executed by src/__tests__/script-tests-runner.test.ts,
which invokes every scripts/__tests__/*.test.py WITHOUT arguments -- so this file
must be self-contained and take no required argument.

WHAT IT PINS
  A message that arrives inside the chat's quiet window must not be blocked and
  must not increment the stop counter (03:57 -> checks at 01:58 / 01:59 / 02:30),
  and it must still be enforced once the window closes (07:01), because the
  staleness clock runs from the window END rather than from arrival. Without that
  second half the reminder goes stale overnight and is silently dropped.

NEGATIVE CONTROL, IN THIS FILE
  A green probe proves nothing on its own: it has to fail on the unpatched shape.
  This file builds that shape at run time by cutting the quiet-hours block out of
  the guard source, and asserts the probe FAILS on it. The cut is verified (both
  markers found, the result is shorter, and `in_quiet` is gone), so a marker drift
  turns the control loud instead of vacuous.

DATA
  No real identifier appears here. The chat id, the message text and the payload
  cwd are fixtures. That loses no coverage: the probe always wrote its own
  quiet-hours.json into a temp dir, so a real id was only ever the key of a
  throwaway file -- it never tested the site's configuration, and neither does this.

  The payload cwd matters more than it looks: the guard resolves its state dir
  from CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or the cwd, so a cwd that does not exist yields no
  quiet-hours.json and makes in_quiet False for EVERY chat. A probe that inherited
  such a default would measure the fail-open state it is meant to exclude, and
  would pass while doing it. Hence the explicit fixture below.
