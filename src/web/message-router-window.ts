/**
 * Which pending rows one router tick evaluates (card fc5748f5).
 *
 * It used to be `localPending.slice(0, MAX_MESSAGES_PER_TICK)`: the globally
 * oldest rows. When those belonged to busy recipients, every other recipient,
 * idle ones included, was not evaluated at all that tick, and the next tick saw
 * the same window. Measured 2026-09-23 13:4xZ: 86 pending, the oldest from
 * 11:35Z, and an idle agent's rows untouched for over an hour without even a
 * "busy, will retry" line, because the router never looked at them.
 *
 * Now the window is filled round-robin across recipients: each round takes the
 * next row of every recipient, recipients ordered by their oldest pending row,
 * until `max` rows. So every recipient with a pending row is evaluated every
 * tick (up to `max` recipients), a lone recipient still gets up to `max` rows
 * (the serial path delivers exactly as before), and each recipient's rows keep
 * their order, which the batch-mate collection relies on (it looks AFTER the
 * head row).
 *
 * The main agent's rows are left out: it drains its own inbox (pull model) and
 * the tick skips its rows anyway, so in the window they only took a slot.
 *
 * Card 71263d15 (C): STOP rows come first, whatever their recipient's backlog. The
 * round-robin takes each recipient's rows oldest first, so the newest row of a
 * recipient with a deep queue did not reach the window at all, and a STOP is always
 * the newest row.
